# Motivation

This project is focused on developing data strategies to address systemic gaps in financial literacy and foster financial equity. It aims to establish a 'Debit Score' system to evaluate creditworthiness based on debit transaction usage, offering an alternative to traditional credit scores. This strategy benefits individuals in underserved communities who often lack a conventional credit history due to systemic biases in traditional financial institutions. 

# Goal

The goal is to develop a linear regression model utilizing the available dataset of consumer debit spending behaviors, particularly focusing on debit utilization rate, average days between transactions, number of transactions to income ratio, and overdraft occurrences. This project aims to predict creditworthiness and create a tool for financial instituations to expand credit-building opportunities. The model aims to identify individuals from marginalized communities who demonstrate responsible financial behaviors despite lacking traditional credit histories.
